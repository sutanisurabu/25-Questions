Prompt models you want to test with the problems generated by the generator LLM.
Problem difficulty is inversely proportional to probability/perplexity for all models (see the 16 Questions article), so testing just one model with a list of problems with decreasing probability will allow you to predict their relative difficulty for all other models, even if some individual task variation is expected.
In this experiment, the tested model was LLaMa 4 Maverick Instruct. I needed a model that'd start failing earlier, and there was no less capable model than LLaMa.
I have also cleaned up the prompt returned by GPT 5 to make sure it contains only the evaluation problem.

# User

- Task: Given an integer N followed by N integers, output their sum.
- Input:
  - Line 1: N (0 ≤ N ≤ 200000)
  - Line 2+: N space-separated integers a_i (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)
- Output: Single integer — the sum of all a_i.
- Notes:
  - If N = 0, output 0.
  - Ensure the chosen numeric type can hold the sum (e.g., up to about 2×10^14 under the given constraints).

# Problem Understanding

The task is to write a program that takes an integer N as input, followed by N space-separated integers, and outputs their sum. The key constraints and edge cases are:

- N is an integer between 0 and 200,000 (inclusive).
- The N integers are space-separated and can be between -10^9 and 10^9 (inclusive).
- If N = 0, the program should output 0.
- The program should be able to handle large sums, up to about 2×10^14 under the given constraints.

The input consists of two parts: the first line contains N, and the subsequent lines contain N space-separated integers. The output is a single integer representing the sum of the N integers.

A subtle requirement is that the chosen numeric type should be able to hold the sum of the N integers.

# Key Insights

The crucial observations that lead to the solution are:

- The input format is specific, with N on the first line and the N integers on subsequent lines.
- The program needs to handle large values of N and large integers.
- The sum of the N integers can be large, requiring a suitable numeric type.
- If N = 0, the program should output 0 without attempting to read N integers.
- The input integers can be negative, zero, or positive.
- The program should be able to handle cases where N is large (up to 200,000).

The key algorithmic insight is that the program can read N, then read the N integers, store them in a data structure (or directly sum them), and finally sum them up.

Important realizations include:

- The need to check if N = 0 and handle this case separately.
- The need to use a suitable numeric type that can handle large sums.
- The fact that the input integers are space-separated, requiring a suitable input reading mechanism.

Critical examples or test cases that led to insights include:

- N = 5, integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], expected output = 15.
- N = 3, integers = [-2, 0, 7], expected output = 5.
- N = 0, expected output = 0.

# Solution Strategy

The steps to solve this problem are:

1. Read N from the first line of input.
2. Check if N = 0. If so, output 0 immediately.
3. Read the N integers from the subsequent lines of input.
4. Store the N integers in a suitable data structure (or directly sum them).
5. Sum up the N integers using a suitable numeric type that can handle large sums.
6. Output the sum as a single integer.

Important optimizations or special cases to handle include:

- Handling the case where N = 0 separately to avoid attempting to read N integers.
- Using a suitable numeric type that can handle large sums.
- Ensuring that the input reading mechanism can handle space-separated integers.

Here's the python solution:
```python
def main():
    try:
        N = int(input().strip())
        if N == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            numbers = []
            lines = []
            while len(lines) < N:
                try:
                    line = input().strip()
                    lines.extend(line.split())
                except EOFError:
                    break
            for num in lines[:N]:
                try:
                    numbers.append(int(num))
                except ValueError:
                    # In a real application, you'd log this error
                    return
            if len(numbers) == N:
                print(sum(numbers))
            else:
                # Handle the case where not enough numbers were provided
                return
    except ValueError:
        # In a real application, you'd log this error
        return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
