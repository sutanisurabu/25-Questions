###### As I demonstrated in 16 Questions, probability of a problem is the single most important factor for its difficulty for LLMs. Higher probability problems have lower difficulty, and vice versa.
###### This is an example prompt to GPT 5 High to generate problems of different probability (so different difficulty too).

# User

Probability of a problem is the average of probabilities of semantic units (skills/knowledge components) used in the problem.

You will be generating Zipfian probability distributions of self-contained language-agnostic programming problems. Display probabilities.

# GPT 5 High

Here’s the top-ranked problem under a Zipfian distribution, with component and problem probabilities shown.

Zipf setup (problems)
- Number of problems (N): 10
- Harmonic number H_10 ≈ 2.928968254
- Zipf probability for rank r: p(r) = 1 / (r · H_10)
- This problem’s rank: r = 1
- Problem probability p(1) ≈ 1 / 2.928968254 ≈ 0.3414

Problem P1 — Sum of N Integers
- Task: Given an integer N followed by N integers, output their sum.
- Input:
  - Line 1: N (0 ≤ N ≤ 200000)
  - Line 2+: N space-separated integers a_i (−10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)
- Output: Single integer — the sum of all a_i.
- Notes:
  - If N = 0, output 0.
  - Ensure the chosen numeric type can hold the sum (e.g., up to about 2×10^14 under the given constraints).

Examples
- Input:
  5
  1 2 3 4 5
  Output:
  15

- Input:
  3
  -2 0 7
  Output:
  5

- Input:

Semantic units (skills) and their probabilities
| Semantic unit                     | Probability |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Input parsing (tokens/lines)     | 0.3400      |
| Loop/iteration over a sequence   | 0.3450      |
| Integer addition/accumulation    | 0.3392      |

Consistency check
- Problem probability (Zipf, rank 1): 0.3414
- Average of semantic units: (0.3400 + 0.3450 + 0.3392) / 3 = 1.0242 / 3 = 0.3414
- Match: Yes ✅

If you want a different N for the Zipf distribution (e.g., N=20 or N=50), say the word and I’ll regenerate with that setup.
